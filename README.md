# RoboScout
Framework for web-based FRC scouting.

## Installing on a server
In most cases, including when competing in locations that block hosting of local servers, you'll want to have the all-important scouting system hosted online. This will help keep pit clutter down to a minimum, and you'll be able to access it from anywhere.

### Requirements for this method
* A public web server (your team's website is probably the best option)
* [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) on that server

1. Place the files on your server. You can use FTP or some other method. It's recommended you put them in a subdirectory if there's anything else on the server.
2. When you need to fetch the data, download `data.json`.
3. TODO: JSON => CSV
